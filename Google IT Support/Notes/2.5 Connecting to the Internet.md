## Dial-up and Modems

In the late 1970s, two graduate students at Duke University were trying to come up with a better way to connect computers at further distances.
 
**The Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)**, is also sometimes referred to as the Plain Old Telephone Service or POTS.
  - **NOTE**: While POTS and PSTN are related, they are not entirely interchangeable. POTS refers specifically to the traditional analog voice communication service. PSTN refers to the global system of interconnected telephone networks, both analog and digital.

These Duke grad students weren't the first ones to think about using a phone line to transmit data. But they were the first to do it in a way that became somewhat permanent precursor to the dial-up networks to follow. The system they built is known as Usenet and a form of it is still in use today.

A dial-up connection uses POTS for data transfer and gets its name because the connection is established by actually dialing a phone number.

Modem stands for modulator demodulator and they take data that computers can understand and turn them into audible wavelengths that can be transmitted over POTS. After all, the telephone system was developed to transmit voice messages or sounds from one place to another. This is conceptually similar to how line coding is used to turn ones and zeros into modulating electrical charges across Ethernet cables. Early modems had very low baud rates. A baud rate is a measurement of how many bits could be passed across a phone line in a second.

By the late 1950s, computers could generally only send each other data across a phone line at about 110 bits per second. By the time Usenet was being developed, this rate had increased to around 300 bits per second. By the time dial-up access to the Internet became a household commodity in the early 1990s, this rate had increased to 14.4 kilo bits per seconds.

## What is Broadband

- **Broadband** - Any connectivity technology that isn't dial-up Internet.
  - Broadband Internet is almost always much faster than even the fastest dial up connections and refers to connections that are always on.

By the mid-1990s, it had become pretty common for businesses that needed Internet access for their employees to use various T-carrier technologies. 

- **T-carrier Technologies** - Originally invented by AT&T in order to transmit multiple phone calls over a single link.

T-carrier technologies require dedicated lines, which makes them more expensive. For this reason, you usually only see them in use by businesses. But other broadband solutions also exist for both businesses and consumers.

---

## T-carrier Technologies

The first T carrier specification was called T1 for short. With the T1 specification, AT&T invented a way to carry up to 24 simultaneous phone calls across a single piece of twisted pair copper. 

Years later, this same technology was repurposed for data transfers. Each of the 24 phone channels was capable of transmitting data at 64 kilobits per second, making a single T1 line capable of transmitting data at 1.544 megabits per second. Over the years, the phrase T1 has come to mean any twisted pair copper connection capable of speeds of 1.544 megabits per second, even if it doesn't strictly follow the original transmission system 1 specification.

More improvements to the T1 line were made by developing a way of multiple T1s to act as a single link. A T3 line is 28 T1s all multiplexed, achieving a total throughput speed of 44.736 megabits per second.

## Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL)

- **Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)** uses existing twisted-pair copper telephone lines to deliver high-speed internet by operating on frequency ranges that do not interfere with voice calls.
- DSL allows **simultaneous voice and data transmission** on the same phone line.
- Unlike dial-up, DSL connections are **always on** and do not need to be re-established for each session.

- DSL uses specialized devices called **DSLAMs (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers)** to establish and maintain data connections over phone lines.

---

### Common Types of DSL

- **ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)**  
  - Faster download speeds than upload speeds.  
  - Designed primarily for home users who consume more data than they send.  
  - Lower cost while providing a similar experience for typical web usage.

- **SDSL (Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line)**  
  - Equal upload and download speeds.  
  - Originally used by businesses hosting servers.  
  - Common maximum speed of **1.544 Mbps**, equivalent to a T1 line.

- **HDSL (High-bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line)**  
  - An advancement of SDSL that supports speeds greater than **1.544 Mbps**.

- Many additional DSL variations exist with differing speeds and distance limitations.  
- Specific DSL capabilities depend on the ISP and infrastructure.

---

## Cable Broadband Internet

- **Cable broadband** delivers high-speed internet over **coaxial cables** originally installed for cable television.
- Coaxial cables can transmit significantly more data than required for TV by using **frequency ranges that do not interfere with television signals**.

- Cable internet differs from DSL in that it is a **shared bandwidth technology**.
  - Multiple users share a fixed amount of bandwidth until traffic reaches the ISP’s core network.
  - The shared segment may cover anything from a **single block to entire neighborhoods**, depending on infrastructure design.
  - Performance can decrease during **peak usage times** when many users are active simultaneously.

- Unlike DSL, which typically provides a **point-to-point connection** to a central office (CO), cable internet connections share capacity among nearby subscribers.

### Cable Internet Infrastructure

- **Cable Modem** - A device located at the customer’s premises that connects the local network to the cable provider.
- **CMTS (Cable Modem Termination System)** - Aggregates traffic from many cable modems and connects them to the ISP’s core network.

- Modern cable networks have been upgraded to reduce congestion, but shared bandwidth behavior can still impact speeds under heavy load.

## Fiber Connections

### Fiber Internet & FTTX

- **Fiber-optic networking** uses **light instead of electrical signals** to transmit data.
- Fiber supports **much higher speeds** and can transmit data over **much longer distances** without signal degradation.
  - Copper cabling requires repeaters after **thousands of feet**.
  - Fiber can transmit data over **many miles** before degradation occurs.

- Due to higher cost, fiber was historically used mainly by **ISPs in core networks** and **data centers**.
- In recent years, fiber has been deployed **closer to end users**, leading to various implementation models.

### FTTX (Fiber To The X)

- **FTTX** is a general term describing how close fiber is run to the end user.
- The “X” represents the termination point of the fiber connection.

#### Common FTTX Implementations

- **FTTN (Fiber To The Neighborhood)**  
  - Fiber runs to a local cabinet serving a neighborhood.  
  - The final connection to homes uses **twisted-pair copper or coaxial cable**.

- **FTTB (Fiber To The Building / Business / Basement)**  
  - Fiber runs to a single building.  
  - Internal connections typically use **twisted-pair copper**.

- **FTTH (Fiber To The Home)**  
  - Fiber is run directly to individual residences.  
  - Provides the highest performance and least signal loss.

- **FTTP (Fiber To The Premises)**  
  - General term that includes **FTTB and FTTH**.

### Optical Network Terminator (ONT)

- **ONT (Optical Network Terminator)** - The demarcation point for fiber connections.
- Converts fiber network signals into protocols usable by traditional copper-based networks.
- Replaces the traditional modem used in DSL or cable connections.

## Supplemental Reading for Broadband Protocols

### Broadband Protocols

Broadband communications rely on defined instructions and rules that work with network layer protocols to support data transmission. One commonly used protocol for broadband communication is **Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)**, which enables data transmission between two directly connected devices.

This reading covers the definitions, structure, and functionality of **Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)** and **Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE)**.

### Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)

- **Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)** is a **byte-oriented protocol** commonly used for high-traffic data transmissions.
- PPP operates at the **Data Link layer**, transmitting data between two devices on the same network.
- PPP is vendor-independent, allowing devices from different manufacturers to communicate with each other.

### Configuring PPP

When configuring PPP, the following options are available:

- **Multilink Connection**  
  - Allows traffic to be spread across multiple PPP connections.

- **Compression**  
  - Increases throughput by reducing the amount of data in each frame.

- **Authentication**  
  - Connected devices exchange authentication messages using one of the following methods:
    - **Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)**  
      - Uses passwords for authentication and makes plaintext passwords difficult to obtain if compromised.
    - **Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP)**  
      - Uses a three-way handshake and periodically verifies client identity.

- **Error Detection**
  - Includes **Frame Check Sequence (FCS)** and **looped link detection**.
    - **Frame Check Sequence (FCS)**  
      - A calculated value included in the frame to detect data loss or corruption during transmission.
    - **Looped Link Detection**  
      - Uses randomly generated **magic numbers** at each endpoint.
      - If a received magic number matches the sender’s own, the frame is discarded, indicating a looped connection.

### PPP Sub-protocols

PPP uses two sub-protocols at the network layer to manage connections and configuration:

- **Network Control Protocol (NCP)**  
  - Negotiates optional configuration parameters and facilities for network layer protocols.
  - Each higher-layer protocol has its own NCP.

- **Link Control Protocol (LCP)**  
  - Automatically initiates and terminates connections.
  - Configures link options such as authentication methods and magic numbers.

### PPP Frames

- Data transmitted using PPP is encapsulated in a **frame**.
- A **frame** is a structured collection of data sent from a source to a destination.

## Wide Area Network (WAN) Technologies

- **Wide Area Network (WAN)** - Acts like a single network, but spans across multiple physical locations.

WAN technologies usually require that you contract a link across the Internet with your isp. This ISP handles sending your data from one site to the other. So it could be like all of your computers are in the same physical location. 

Purpose: Enables offices in different cities to communicate and share resources.

WAN Components:

- Demarcation Point: Boundary where the ISP’s network takes over.
- In a WAN, a local loop is the area between a demarcation point and the ISP's core network.
- Local Loop: Connection from office to ISP’s regional office (e.g., T-carrier, fiber).
- ISP Core Network: Routes data between locations and to the Internet.

Protocols: Use data link layer protocols to transport data between sites (may differ from Ethernet).

## Point-to-Point VPNs

A popular alternative to WAN technologies are point-to-point VPNs. WAN technologies are great for when you need to transport large amounts of data across lots of sites because WAN technologies are built to be super fast. Business cable or DSL line might be way cheaper, but it just can't handle the load required in some of these situations. But over the last few years, companies have been moving more and more of their internal services into the Cloud.

- Point-to-Point VPN (Site-to-Site VPN): Connects two locations via a secure VPN tunnel.

- Purpose: Allows sites to communicate without requiring a full WAN.

- Use Case: Useful when Cloud services reduce the need for high-speed WAN links.

- How it works: Network devices at each site handle the VPN tunnel; individual users don’t need separate VPN connections.

Comparison to WAN:

- WAN: High-speed, designed for large amounts of data across many sites.

- VPN: Cheaper alternative for connecting specific sites when full WAN is unnecessary.

## Introduction to Wireless Networking Technologies

The most common specifications for how wireless networking devices should communicate are defined by the IEEE 802.11 standards. This set of specifications, also called the 802.11 family, make up the set of technologies we call Wi Fi. 

Wireless networking devices communicate with each other through radio waves. Different 802.11 standards generally use the same basic protocol, but might operate at different frequency bands. 

- **Frequency Band** - A certain section of the radio spectrum that's been agreed upon to be used for certain communications. 

In North America, FM radio transmissions operate between 88 and 108 MHz. This specific frequency band is called the FM broadcast band. WiFi networks operate on a few different frequency bands, most commonly the 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz bands. 

- **802.11 = physical and data link layers.**

An 802.11 frame has a number of fields:

1. **Frame Control Field** - Is a 16 bits long and contains a number of subfields that are used to describe how the frame itself should be processed.
      - This includes things like what version of the 802.11 was used.
2. **Duration Field** - It specifies how long the Total frame is so the receiver knows how long it should expect to have to listen to the transmission.
3. **Four address fields** - There are four address fields because there needs to be room to indicate which wireless access point should be processing the frame.
    1. **Source Address Field** - Represents the Mac address of the sending device.
    2. **Intended Destination** - The intended destination on the network.
    3. **Receiving Address** - The Mac address of the access point that should receive the frame. 
    4. **Transmitter Address** - The Mac address of whatever has just transmitted the frame.

- **Wireless Access Point** - A device that bridges the wireless and wired portions of a network.

In lots of situations, the destination and receiver address might be the same. Usually the source and transmitter addresses are also the same. But depending on exactly how a specific wireless network has been architected, this won't always be the case. Sometimes wireless access points will relay these frames from one another. 

Since all addresses in an 802.11 frame are Mac addresses, each of those four fields is six bytes long. 

**In between the third and fourth address fields, you'll find the sequence control field. The sequence control field is 16 bits long and mainly contains a sequence number used to keep track of ordering the frames. After this is the data payload section, which has all of the data of the protocols further up the stack. Finally, we have a frame check sequence field, which contains a checksum used for a cyclical redundancy check, just like how Ethernet does it.**

## Wireless Network Configurations

There are a few main ways that a wireless network can be configured:

- Ad-hoc Networks -  Nodes all speak directly to each other.
  - Ad-hoc networks are the simplest of the three. In an ad-hoc network, there isn't really any supporting network infrastructure. Every device involved with the network communicates with every other device within range, and all nodes help pass along messages. Even though they're the most simple, ad-hoc networks aren't the most common type of wireless network, but they do have some practical applications. Some smartphones can establish ad-hoc networks with other smartphones in the area so that people can exchange photos, video, or contact information. You'll also sometimes see ad-hoc networks used in industrial or warehouse settings, where individual pieces of equipment might need to communicate with each other, but not with anything else. Finally, ad-hoc networks can be powerful tools during disaster situations. If a natural disaster like an earthquake or hurricane knocks out all of the existing infrastructure in an area, disaster-relief professionals can use an ad-hoc network to communicate with each other while they perform search and rescue efforts.
- Wireless LANS or WLANS - One or more access points act as a bridge between a wireless and a wired network.
  - The most common type of wireless network you'll run into in the business world is a wireless LAN, or WLAN. A wireless LAN consists of one or more access points which act as bridges between the wireless and wired networks. The wired network operates as a normal LAN, like the types we've already discussed. The wired LAN contains the outbound Internet link. In order to access resources outside of the WLAN, wireless devices would communicate with access points. They then forward traffic along to the gateway router where everything proceeds like normal.
- Mesh networks - A hybrid of the two.
  - Mesh networks are like ad-hoc networks, since lots of the devices communicate with each other wirelessly, forming a mesh if you were to draw lines for all the links between all the nodes. Most mesh networks you'll run into are made up of only wireless access points and will still be connected to a wired network. This network lets you deploy more access points to the mesh without having to run a cable to each of them. With this setup, you can really increase the performance and range of a wireless network.

## Wireless Channels

- **Channels** - Individual, smaller sections of the overall frequency band used by a wireless network.

Channels are super important because they help address a very old networking concern, collision domains. 
 
- **Collision Domain** - Any one network segment where one computer can interrupt another.

---

## Wireless Security

With wireless networking there aren't cables, just radio transmissions being broadcast through the air, and anyone within range could hypothetically intercept any transmissions, whether they were intended for them or not. To solve this problem, WEP was invented. 

- **Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)** -  An encryption technology that provides a very low level of privacy.
    - Using WEP protects your data a little, but it should really only be seen as being as safe as sending unencrypted data over a wired connection. The WEP standard is a really weak encryption algorithm. It doesn't take very long for a bad actor to be able to break through this encryption and read your data. WEP only uses 40 bits for its encryption keys, and with the speed of modern computers, this can usually be cracked in just a few minutes. 

WEP was quickly replaced in most places with WPA, or Wi-Fi Protected Access. WPA by default uses a 128-bit key, making it a whole lot more difficult to crack than WEP. Today, the most commonly used encryption algorithm for wireless networks is WPA2, an update to the original WPA. WPA2 uses a 256-bit key, making it even harder to crack. Another common way to help secure wireless networks is through MAC filtering. 

- **MAC Filtering** - You configure your access points to only allow for connections from a specific set of MAC addresses belonging to devices you trust. 
  - This doesn't do anything more to help encrypt wireless traffic being sent through the air. But it does provide an additional barrier, preventing unauthorized devices from connecting to the wireless network itself.

## Cellular Networking (Mobile Networking)

Just like Wi-Fi, cellular networking operates over radio waves, and there are specific frequency bands specifically reserved for cellular transmissions. One of the biggest differences is that these frequencies can travel over longer distances more easily, usually over many kilometers or miles.
