### <u>CPUs</u>

There are currently two major types of CPU sockets
- **Land Grid Array (LGA) Sockets** - An LGA socket has pins coming out of the motherboard
- **Pin Grid Array (PGA) Sockets** - A PGA socket has pins coming out of the processor itself.

### <u>RAM</u>

 RAM is used to store data we want to access quickly. To run a program we need to make a copy of it in RAM so the CPU can process it.

 There are lots of types of RAM, and the one that's commonly found in computers is DRAM, or **dynamic random-access memory**.

 - **Dual Inline Memory Module(DIMM)**
 - **Synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM)** - any DRAM where the operation of its external pin interface is coordinated.

 In today's system, we use another type of RAM, called **double data rate SDRAM** or **DDR SDRAM** for short.

 The latest version is DDR5, which is the fifth generation of DDR RAM, released in 2020.

### <u>Motherboards</u>

Every motherboard has a few key characteristics. 
- **Chipset** - Decides how components talk to each other and is made op of two chips.
  - Northbridge - Interconnects RAM and video cards.
  - Southbridge - Maintains input/output (IO) controllers like hard drives and USB devices that input and output data.
  - **NOTE** - In some modern CPUs the Northbridge has been directly integrated into the CPU, so there isn't a seperate Northbridge chipset.

There are different sizes of motherboards that are available today. **Form Factor** determines the amount we can put in and the amount of space we'll have.

The most common form factor for motherboards is ATX (Advanced Technology Extended). Another is ITX (Information Technology Extended), which are much smaller than ATX.

### <u>Physical Storage Hard Drives</u>

There are two basic hard drive types used today.
- HDD or Hard Disk Drive
- SSD or Solid State Drive

There are a few interfaces that hard drives use to connect to our system.
- SATA or Serial ATA - Interface which uses one cable to data transfer. These drives are...
  - Hot Swappable - You don't have to turn off your machine to plug in a SATA drive.
- NVM Express or NVMe

| **Unit** | **Conversion** |
| :------: | :------: |
| 8 bits | 1 byte |
| 1024 Bytes | 1 Kilobyte (KB) |
| 1024 Kilobytes | 1 Megabyte (MB) |
| 1024 Megabytes | 1 Gigabyte (GB) |
| 1024 Gigabytes | 1 Terabyte (TB) |


### <u>Power Supplies</u>

There are 2 types of electricity.
- DC or Direct Current - Flows one direction.
- AC or Alternating Current - Changes directions constantly.

Computers use DC Voltage. The power supply converts the AC voltage from the wall to DC.

Wattage is the amount of volts and amps that a device needs.

### <u>BIOS</u>

- **Basic Input Output Services (BIOS)** - Software that helps initialize the hardware and gets the operating system up and running.

The BIOS is stored on the motherboard in a special type of memory called the <u>Read Only Memory Chip (ROM Chip)</u>.

ROM is non-volatile, meaning it will not erase the data if the computer is turned off.

- **Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)** - Performs the same function of starting your computer as a traditional BIOS, but it's more modern and has better compatibility and support for new hardware. Most hardware out there today comes with UEFI built in.

- **Power On Self Test (POST)** - The POST figures out what hardware is on the computer. It happens before the BIOS initializes any hardware or loads up essential drivers.

There's a special chip on our motherboard called the **<u>CMOS Chip</u>**. It stores basic data about boosting your computer, like the date, time, and how you want it to start up. You can change these settings by booting into CMOS or BIOS settings menu. It varies on different computers, but usually when you boot the computer, there will be a quick screen that tells you what button to push to get into the settings.

### <u>Terms</u>
- **Programs** - Instructions that tell the computer what to do.
- **External Data Bus (EDB)** - A row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer.
- **External Data Bus (EDB)** - A collection of wires that allows a computer to transfer data between the central processing unit (CPU) and other components, including RAM and peripheral devices.
- **Memory Controller Chip (MCC)** - A chip that manages data flow between a computer's central processing unit (CPU) and its main memory (DRAM).
- **Address Bus** - Connects the CPU to the MCC and sends over the location of the data, but not the data itself.
- **Cache** - A temporary memory area that stores frequently accessed data for faster retrieval. There are 3 different cache levels in a CPU: L1, L2, and L3. L1 is the smallest and fastest cache.
- **CPU cache** - CPUs use a system of cache storage to help them quickly access data. A CPU cache is normally stored inside each core of the CPU.
- **Clock Wire** - Carries a clock signal (a series of electrical pulses) to synchronize all components of a computer, including the CPU, so they can perform operations in unison and at a consistent pace.
- **Clock Cycle** - The maximum number of clock cycles that it can handle in a certain time period. ex: 3.40 gHz is 3.4 billion cycles per second.
- **Overclock** - Increases the rate of the cpu clock cycles in order to perform more tasks.
- **Peripherals** - External devices we connect to our computer like a mouse, keyboard, and monitor.
- **Expansion Slots** - Give us the ability to increase the functionality of our computer.
- **System on a Chip (SoC)** - Packs the CPU, RAM, and sometimes even the storage onto a single chip.
- **Inductive charging** - Also known as wireless charging, is a method of transferring electrical energy without a physical connection, using electromagnetic induction.
