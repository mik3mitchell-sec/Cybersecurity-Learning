## Introduction to Troubleshooting 

Computer networking can be an incredibly complicated business. There are so many layers, protocols, and devices at play, and sometimes this means that things just don't work properly. Many of the protocols and devices we've covered, have built in functionalities to help protect against some of these issues. These functionalities are known as error detection and error recovery. 

- **Error Detection** - The ability for a protocol or program to determine that something went wrong.

- **Error Recovery** - The ability for a protocol or program to attempt to fix it.

Even with safeguards in place:
- Errors still pop up
- Misconfigurations occur
- Hardware breaks down
- System incompatibilities come to light

## Ping: Internet Control Message Protocol

- **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** - A core network protocol for reporting errors and diagnostics, sending messages between devices about connectivity issues like unreachable hosts or network problems, famously used by tools like ```ping``` (Echo Request/Reply) for reachability and ```traceroute``` (Time Exceeded) for path tracing, but can also be misused for attacks like DDoS floods. 

ICMP is mainly used by a router or remote host to communicate why a transmission has failed back to the origin of the transmission. The makeup of an ICMP packet is pretty simple. It has a header with a few fields and a data section that's used by a host to figure out which of their transmissions generated the error.
