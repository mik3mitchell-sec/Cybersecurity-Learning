## Basics of Networking

The interconnection of computers is called a network. Computers in a network can talk to each other and send data to one another. You can create a simple network with just two computers. In the IT field, managing, building, and designing networks is known as networking. 

Clients don't connect directly to the Internet. Instead, they connect to a network run by an Internet service provider or ISP, like CenturyLink, Level 3, Comcast, Telefonica and things like that. ISPs have already built networks and run all the unnecessary physical cabling that connects millions of computers together in one network. They also connect to other networks and other ISPs. These other networks connect to the networks of Google, Reddit, universities, basically all the other networks in the world. Together, they form one giant network of computers called the Internet. 

### <u>Network Hardware</u>

- **Ethernet Cable** - Let's you physically connect to the network through a cable.
- **WIFI** - Wireless networks
- **Fiber Optic Cables** - Allow greater speeds than the other methods.
- **Router** - Connects lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic.
- **Switches** -
- **Hubs** -

### <u>TCP/IP</u>

Networking protocols have rules that make sure packets are routed efficiently, aren't corrupted, are secure, go to the right machine, and are named appropriately. 

- **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)** - Delivers information from one network to another.
- **Internet Protocol** - Responsible for delivering packets to the right computer.


### <u>Terms</u>
