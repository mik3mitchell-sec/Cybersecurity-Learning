## 🚀 Introduction to IT

### What is IT?
- Information Technology (IT) - The use of digital technology, like computers and the internet, to store and process data into useful information.

### What Does an IT Support Specialist Do?
- Makes sure that an organization's technological equipment is running smoothly. This includes managing, installing, maintaining, troubleshooting and configuring office and computing equipment.

## 🕰️ History

- **Abacus:** invented in 500 BC to count large numbers  
- **The Mechanical Calculator:** Created in the 17th century by Blaise Pascal. This device uses a series of gears and levers to perform calculations for the user automatically.  
- **The Programmable Loom:** In the 1800s, a man by the name of Joseph Jacquard invented a programmable loom. These looms took a sequence of cards with holes in them.  
- **Charles Babbage:** An engineer who developed a series of machines that are now known as the greatest breakthrough on our way to the modern computer. **The Difference Engine and The Analytical Engine**.  
- **Ada Lovelace:** A visionary mathematician and writer who is considered the world's first computer programmer. She developed the first algorithm for Charles Babbage's engine.  
- Until the 1950's, **Punchcards** were a popular way to store data. These would eventually be replaced by **magnetic tape**.  
- Konrad Ernst Otto Zuse created the world's first programmable computer; the functional program-controlled Turing-complete Z3 became operational in May 1941.  
- In 1952, Admiral Grace Hopper invented the first computer compiler, called A-0.  
- The Xerox Alto (1973) was the first computer that resembled the computers we're familiar with now. There was also the first computer to implement a graphical user interface that use icons, a mouse, and a window.  
- In the 1970s, a young engineer named Steve Wozniak invented the Apple 1, a single-board computer meant for hobbyists.  
- In the 1980s, IBM introduced its personal computer. It was released with a primitive version of an operating system called MS DOS or Microsoft Disk Operating System.  
- Unix was an operating system developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, but it wasn't cheap and it wasn't available to everyone.  
- Richard Stallman start developing a free Unix-like operating system that he called GNU. It was meant to be free to use with similar functionality to Unix.  
- GNU didn't evolve into a full operating system, but it set a foundation for the formation of one of the largest open source operating system, Linux, which was created by Linus Torvalds.  
- By the early 90s, computers started getting even smaller with PDAs or personal digital assistants, which allows computing to go mobile.  
- In the late 1990s, Nokia introduced the PDA with mobile phone functionality.  
- Today we all carry pocket sized computers called smartphones.

## 🔌 Logic Gates

Six common logic gates:

### NOT Gate
- The NOT gate is the simplest because it has only one input signal. The NOT gate takes that input signal and outputs a signal with the opposite binary state. If the input signal is “on,” a NOT gate outputs an “off” signal. If the input signal is “off,” a NOT gate outputs an “on” signal. All the logic gates can be defined using a schematic diagram and truth table.

### AND Gate
- The AND gate involves two input signals rather than just one. Having two input signals means there will be four possible combinations of input values. The AND rule outputs an “on” signal only when both the inputs are “on.” Otherwise, the output signal will be “off.”

### OR Gate
- The OR gate involves two input signals. The OR rule outputs an “off” signal only when both the inputs are “off.” Otherwise, the output signal will be “on.”

### XOR Gate
- The XOR gate also involves two input signals. The XOR rule outputs an “on” signal when only one (but not both) of the inputs are “on.” Otherwise, the output signal will be “off.”

### NAND Gate
- The NAND gate involves two input signals. The NAND rule outputs an “off” signal only when both the inputs are “on.” Otherwise, the output signal will be “on.”

### XNOR Gate
- The XNOR gate also involves two input signals. The XNOR rule outputs an “on” signal only when both the inputs are the same (both “On” or both “Off”). Otherwise, the output signal will be “off.”

### Combining Gates
- Logic gates are physical electronic components—a person can buy them and plug them into a circuit board. Logic gates can be linked together to create complex electrical systems (circuits) that perform complicated binary calculations. You link gates together by letting the output from one gate serve as an input for another gate or by using the same inputs for multiple gates. Computers are this kind of complex electrical system.

## 🔢 Binary Conversion

|               | 1st bit | 2nd bit | 3rd bit | 4th bit | 5th bit | 6th bit | 7th bit | 8th bit |
|---------------|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Decimal Value |  128    |   64    |   32    |   16    |   8     |   4     |   2     |   1     |
| Off or On     |   0     |   0     |   1     |   1     |   0     |   0     |   0     |   1     |

- In the example above, the decimal value is **32 + 16 +1 = 49**.

## 📝 Terms

- **Computer** - A device that stores and processes data by performing calculations.  
- **Algorithm** - A series of steps that solve specific problem.  
- **Cryptography** - The art of writing and solving codes.  
- **Binary System** - The communication that a computer uses, also know as a base-2 numeral system. 1 and 0. In computing terms we group binary into 8 numbers or **bits**.  
- **Bit** - a binary digit.  
- **Byte** - A group of 8 bits. EX: 01100011  
  - Each byte can store one character, and we can have 256 possible values thanks that a base-2 system, two to the eighth ( 2⁸ ).  
- **ASCII** - The oldest character encoding standard. It represents the English alphabet, digits, and punctuation marks.  
- **UTF-8** - The most prevalent encoding standard used today and is built off the Unicode Standard. Along with having the same ASCII table, it also lets us use a variable number of bytes. UTF-8 allows us to store a character in more than one byte.  
- **Logic Gates** - Electrical components that tell a computer how to perform binary calculations. They specify rules for how to produce an electrical output based on one or more electrical inputs.  
- **Abstraction** - To take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use.
