## Components of an Operating System

- 🖥 **Operating System** - The whole package that manages the computer's resources and lets us interact with it.

There are two main parts to the operating system.
- **Kernel** - the main core of an operating system. It talks directly to our hardware and manages our system's resources. 
  - **File Management** - We write data to our hard drive in the form of data blocks. Different OSs use different file system formats.
    - **File Handling** -
      - *Data* -
      - *Metadata* - Tells us everything we need to know about our file. Information on file owner, permissions, file size, date modified, date created, file type.
      - *File System* - Windows = NTFS; Linux = EXT4
  - **Process Management** - There can be many processes of the same program running at the same time. The system is always running multiple processes that are necessary for it to function and the kernel takes care of all of the processes. It doesn't happen all at once, but they are processed by the CPU in ***Time Slices***.
  - **Memory Management** -The kernel optimizes memory usage and make sure our applications have enough memory to run.
  - **I/O Management** - Anything that can give us input, or that we can use for output of data.
- **User Space** - things that we interact with directly like system programs, user interfaces, etc.

## 📝 Terms
- **Kernel** - Creates process, efficiently schedules them, and manages how processes are terminated.
- **Block Storage** - Improves faster handling of data because the data isn't stored as one long piece and can be accessed quicker.
- **File Extension** - The appended part of a filename that tells us what type of file it is in certain operating systems.
- **Process** - A program that's executing, like out internet browser or text editor.
- **Time Slice** - A very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution.
