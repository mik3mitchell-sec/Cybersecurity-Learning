## 🖥️ Components of an Operating System

- **Operating System** - The whole package that manages the computer's resources and lets us interact with it.

There are two main parts to the operating system.
- **Kernel** - the main core of an operating system. It talks directly to our hardware and manages our system's resources. 
  - **File Management** - We write data to our hard drive in the form of data blocks. Different OSs use different file system formats.
    - **File Handling** -
      - *Data* -
      - *Metadata* - Tells us everything we need to know about our file. Information on file owner, permissions, file size, date modified, date created, file type.
      - *File System* - Windows = NTFS; Linux = EXT4
  - **Process Management** - There can be many processes of the same program running at the same time. The system is always running multiple processes that are necessary for it to function and the kernel takes care of all of the processes. It doesn't happen all at once, but they are processed by the CPU in ***Time Slices***.
  - **Memory Management** -The kernel optimizes memory usage and make sure our applications have enough memory to run.
  - **I/O Management** - Anything that can give us input, or that we can use for output of data.
- **User Space** - things that we interact with directly like system programs, user interfaces, etc.

## 🧠 Memory Management and Virtual Memory

- **Memory Requirements for Processes**  
  - Every running process needs **CPU time** *and* **memory space**.  
  - Processes must be loaded into memory so the system can access and run them quickly.

- **Why We Need Virtual Memory**  
  - RAM is much smaller than storage (HDD/SSD).  
  - **Virtual Memory** = RAM + reserved hard drive space acting together as usable memory. This allows the system to run more processes than physical RAM alone would allow.

- **Pages** - Programs are broken into chunks called **pages**. These pages are stored in virtual memory until needed. Only the pages required at a given moment are loaded into RAM.

- **Why Not Load the Entire Program into RAM?**  
  - Large applications would take up unnecessary space.  
  - Most of the program’s features aren’t used at the same time.  

- **Swap Space**  
  - The portion of the hard drive reserved for virtual memory is called **swap space**. When setting up partitions during installation, swap space is typically allocated.

- **Kernel’s Role**  
  - The kernel manages the transfer of pages between RAM and virtual memory. This process is called **swapping**. This ensures efficient memory usage across all running processes.

### 🔛 I/O Management

- **I/O Devices**: Hardware devices that handle input/output, such as:
  - Monitors, keyboards, mice, hard drives, speakers, Bluetooth headsets, webcams, network adapters.
- **Kernel Role**:
  - Loads device drivers to communicate with hardware.
  - Manages transfer of data in and out of devices.
  - Ensures devices can communicate with each other efficiently.
  - Handles error checking during data transfer.
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Resource bottlenecks can cause slowness: insufficient RAM, CPU, or overloaded I/O channels.
  - Troubleshooting slow systems often involves identifying memory, CPU, or I/O limitations.
- **IT Support Relevance**:
  - Understanding I/O and memory bottlenecks helps improve system performance.
  - Key skill for troubleshooting and optimizing desktop or server performance.

### 🖱️ User Space - Interacting With the OS

There are two ways that we can interact with our OS. With a shell or graphical user interface.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** - A visual way to interact with the computer.
- **Shell** - A program that interprets text commands and sends them to the OS to execute.  

In an IT support role it's vital for you to know how to use a shell. Some tasks can only be completed through commands. In more advanced IT roles, you might have to manage thousands of machines. You don't want to have to click a button or drag a window on every machine when you can just run a command once.

### 🥾 The Boot Process

**Booting**: The process of starting a computer from a powered-off state until the operating system is fully operational. The term comes from "pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps."

1. **Power On** - The computer is powered on.

2. **BIOS/UEFI Initialization** - Low-level software (BIOS or UEFI) initializes hardware to ensure everything is ready to run.

3. **Power-On Self-Test (POST)** - Performs diagnostic tests to verify that the computer is functioning correctly.

4. **Boot Device Selection** - BIOS/UEFI checks devices (hard drives, USB drives, CD drives, etc.) in a configured boot order to locate a bootloader.

5. **Bootloader Execution** - A small program called the bootloader is found and executed to begin loading the operating system.

6. **Operating System Loading** - The bootloader loads the larger operating system program and eventually loads the kernel.

7. **Kernel Initialization** - The kernel manages access to hardware resources, loads drivers, and prepares the system for operation.

8. **System Processes and User Space Launch** - Essential system processes and user interface elements (login, desktop environment, etc.) are started, allowing the user to interact with the system.

**End Result**: After these steps, the operating system is fully loaded, and the user can start working on the computer.

## 📝 Terms
- **Kernel** - Creates process, efficiently schedules them, and manages how processes are terminated.
- **Block Storage** - Improves faster handling of data because the data isn't stored as one long piece and can be accessed quicker.
- **File Extension** - The appended part of a filename that tells us what type of file it is in certain operating systems.
- **Process** - A program that's executing, like out internet browser or text editor.
- **Time Slice** - A very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution.
- **Virtual Memory** - The combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that processes can use.
- **Logs** - Files that record system events on our computer, just like a system's diary.
