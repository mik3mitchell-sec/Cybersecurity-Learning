## The Bits & Bytes of Networking

- **Protocol** - A defined set of standards that computers must follow in order to communicate properly.

- **Computer Networking** - The name we've given to the full scope of how computers communicate with each other. 

There are lots of models used to describe the different layers at play with computer networking. But for this course, we've selected the **TCP/IP five-layer model**.

## The TCP/IP Five -Layer Network Model

![Five-Layer Model](/Google%20IT%20Support/Notes/assets/images/Five-Layer_Network_Model.png)

1) **Physical Layer** - Represents the physical devices that interconnect computers.
    - This includes the specifications for the networking cables and the connectors that join devices together, along with specifications describing how signals are sent over these connections.

2) **Data Link Layer** - Responsible for defining a common way of interpreting these signals so network devices can communicate.
    - Lots of protocols exist at the data link layer, but the most common is known as Ethernet, although wireless technologies are becoming more and more popular.

  - The **Ethernet standards** also define a protocol responsible for getting data to nodes on the same network or link.

3) **Network Layer** (Sometimes called the Internet Layer) - Allows different networks to communicate with each other through devices known as routers.
    - **Internetwork** - A collection of networks connected together through routers, the most famous of these being the Internet.

4) **Transport Layer** - Sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get that data.
    - The protocol most commonly used in the fourth layer, the transport layer, is known as **TCP or Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP)**.

5) **Application Layer** - Application specific. Protocols used to allow you to browse the web or send and receive email are some common ones.

**EXPAMLE:** ![Five-Layer Model Example](/Google%20IT%20Support/Notes/assets/images/Five-Layer_Network_Model-Example.png)

You can think of layers like different aspects of a package being delivered. 

1) The physical layer is the delivery truck and the roads. 

2) The data link layer is how the delivery trucks get from one intersection to the next over and over.

3) The network layer identifies which roads need to be taken to to get from address A to address B. 

4) The transport layer ensures that delivery driver knows how to knock on your door to tell you your package has arrived.

5) The application layer is the contents of the package itself.

## 🔌 Cables

- **Cables** - Connect different devices to each other, allowing data to be transmitted over them.

Most network cables used today can be split into two categories, copper and fiber. Copper cables are the most common form of networking cable. They're made up of multiple pairs of copper wires inside plastic insulator.

You may already know that computers communicate in binary, which people represent with ones and zeros. The sending device communicates binary data across these copper wires by changing the voltage between two ranges. The system at the receiving end is able to interpret these voltage changes as binary ones and zeros, which can then be translated into different forms of data.

The most common forms of copper twisted pair cables used in networking are Cat 5, Cat 5e and Cat 6 cables. These are all shorthand ways of saying category 5 or category 6 cables.

- **Crosstalk** - when an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire.

- **Fiber cables** - contain individual optical fibers, which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair.
  - These tubes of glass can transport beams of light. Unlike copper, which uses electrical voltages, fiber cables use pulses of light to represent the ones and zeros of the underlying data. 

The most common plug is known as an RJ 45 or register Jack 45. It's one of many cable plug specifications, but by far the most common in computer networking. ** **It's the one you usually see at the end of an ethernet cable.**

## Hubs, Switches, & Routers

- **Hubs and Switches** - The primary devices used to connect computers on a single network, usually referred to as a LAN or local area network.

- **Hub** - A physical layer device that allows for connections from many computers at once.
  - It's up to each system connected to the hub to determine if the incoming data was meant for them or to ignore it if it isn't.

- **Collision Domain** - A network segment where only one device can communicate at a time.
  - If multiple systems try sending data at the same time, the electrical pulses sent across the cable can interfere with each other. This causes these systems to have to wait for a quiet period before they try sending their data again.

A much more common way of connecting many computers is with a more sophisticated device known as a network switch, originally known as a **switching hub**. 

A switch is very similar to a hub since you can connect many devices to it so they can communicate. The difference is that while a hub is a Layer 1 or physical layer device, a switch is a Layer 2 or datalink device. 

This means that a switch can actually inspect the contents of the Ethernet protocol data being sent around the network, determine which system the data is intended for, and then only send that data to that one system. This reduces or even completely eliminates the size of collision domains on a network. This leads to fewer retransmissions and a higher overall throughput. 

- **Router** - is a device that knows how to forward data between independent networks.

While a hub is a Layer 1 device, and a switch is a Layer 2 device. A router operates at Layer 3, a network layer. 

Just like a switch can inspect Ethernet data to determine where to send things, a router can inspect IP data to determine where to send things. Routers store internal tables containing information about how to route traffic between lots of different networks all over the world.

- **Core ISP Routers** - form the backbone of the Internet and are directly responsible for how we send and receive data all over the Internet.
  - They don't just handle a lot more traffic than a home or small office router. They also have to deal with much more complexity in making decisions about where to send traffic.

- **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)** - Routers share data with each other via this protocol, which lets them learn about the most optimal paths to forward traffic.

## Ethernet & MAC Addresses 

- **Ethernet** - The protocol most widely used to send data across individual links.
  -  Part of the Data Link layer.
  - Ethernet has been around since 1980.

- **CSMA/CD** - Used to determine when the communications channels are clear, and when a device is free to transmit data.

- **MAC Address** -A globally unique identifier attached to an individual network interface. It's a 48-bit number normally represented by six groupings of two hexadecimal numbers. 

- **Hexadecimal** - A way to represent numbers using 16 digits.
  - Since we don't have numerals to represent any individual digit larger than 9, hexadecimal numbers employ the letters A, B, C, D, E, and F to represent the numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

![Hexadecimal Chart](/Google%20IT%20Support/Notes/assets/images/hexadecimal-chart.png)

- **Octet** -In computer networking, any number that can be represented by 8 bits.

Another way to reference each group of numbers in a Mac address is an octet. An octet in computer networking is any number that can be represented by eight bits. In this case, two hexadecimal digits can represent the same numbers that eight bits can.

- A MAC address is split into two sections.
    - **Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI)** - The first three octets of a Mac address.
      - These are assigned to individual hardware manufacturers by the IEEE or the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
    - The last three octets of a Mac address can be assigned in any way that the manufacturer would like, with the condition that they only assign each possible address once.

Ethernet uses Mac addresses to ensure that the data it sends has both an address for the machine that sent the transmission as well as the one that the transmission was intended for.

## Unicast, Multicast, and Broadcast

- **Unicast transmission** - A unicast transmission is always meant for just one receiving address.
  - If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to zero, it means that ethernet frame is intended for only the destination address.
  - This means it would be sent to all devices on the collision domain, but only actually received and processed by the intended destination. 

- **Multicast** - A way of addressing groups of hosts all at once

- **Multicast Frame** - If the least significant bit in the first octet of a destination address is set to one, it means you're dealing with a multicast frame. A multicast frame is similarly set to all devices on the local network signal, and it will be accepted or discarded by each device depending on criteria aside from their own hardware MAC address

- **Broadcast** - A type of Ethernet transmission, sent to every single device on a LAN

- **Broadcast Address** - A special destination used by an Ethernet broadcast composed by all Fs.
  - FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF

## Dissecting an Ethernet Frame

- **Data Packet** - An all encompassing term that represents any single set of binary data being sent across a network link.

- **Ethernet Frame** - A highly structured collection of information presented in a specific order.
  - Data packets at the Ethernet level are known as Ethernet frames.

**Ethernet Frame:**![Ethernet Frame](/Google%20IT%20Support/Notes/assets/images/Ethernet-Frame.png)

- **Preamble** - An 8 bytes, or 64 bits long, and can itself be split into two sections. 
  -The first seven bytes are a series of alternating ones and zeros. These act partially as a buffer between frames and can also be used by the network interfaces to synchronize internal clocks they use to regulate the speed at which they send data. 
  - This last byte in the preamble is known as the SFD or Start frame delimiter.

- **Start Frame Delimiter (SFD)** - Signals to a receiving device that the preamble is over and that the actual frame contents will now follow.

- **Destination MAC Address** - The hardware address of the intended recipient.

- **Source MAC Address** - Where the frame originated from.

- **Ether-type Field** - 16 bits long and used to describe the protocol of the contents of the frame.

  - ** ***NOTE*** - Instead of the ETHER type field, you could also find what's known as a VLAN header. If a VLAN header is present, the ETHERTYPE field follows it. 

- **VLAN Header** - Indicates that the frame itself is what's called a VLAN frame.

- **Virtual LAN (VLAN)** - A technique that lets you have multiple logical LANs operating on the same physical equipment.
  - Any frame with a VLAN tag will only be delivered out of a switch interface configured to relay that specific tag. This way you can have a single physical network that operates like it's multiple LANs.

- **Payload** - in networking terms, is the actual data being transported, which is everything that isn't a header. 
  - The data payload of a traditional ethernet frame can be anywhere from 46 to 1500 bytes long. This contains all of the data from higher layers, such as the ip, transport and application layers, that's actually being transmitted.

- **Frame Check Sequence** - A 4 byte or 32 bit number that represents a checksum value for the entire frame. 
  - This checksum value is calculated by performing what's known as a cyclical redundancy check against the frame.

- **Cyclical Redundancy Check (CRC)** - An important concept for data integrity and is used all over computing, not just network transmissions. 
  - A CRC is basically a mathematical transformation that uses polynomial division to create a number that represents a larger set of data. Anytime you perform a CRC against a set of data, you should end up with the same checksum number. 
  - The reason it's included in an ethernet frame is so that the receiving network interface can infer if it received uncorrupted data.

## 📝 Terms

- **Node** - Any device connected to a network. On most networks, each node will typically act as a server or a client.
- **Server** - A device that provides data to another device that is requesting that data.
- **Client** - A device that receives data from a server. Requests the data.
- **Modulation** - A way of varying the voltage of a charge moving across the cable.
- **Twisted Pair Cable** - The most common type of cabling used for connecting computing devices. It features pairs of copper wires that are twisted together.
- **Unshielded twisted pair (UTP)** - The most common and least expensive type of Ethernet cable found in business and home networks. UTP cables offer very basic protection against EMI, RFI, and crosstalk interference. 
- **Shielded twisted pair (STP)** - Used in environments where electromagnetic interference (EMI), radio frequency interference (RFI), and crosstalk with nearby cables have been identified as a problem for network communications. An STP cable uses a braided aluminum and/or copper shielding to encase the four twisted pairs underneath the outer jacket. 
- **Foiled twisted pair (FTP)** - Also used in environments where EMI, RFI, and crosstalk are a problem. An FTP cable uses a thin foil shield that wraps around the bundle of twisted pair wires underneath the outer jacket.
